This is my second project as a 42 student, ft_printf. Find it here as it vas evaluated,
and it scored 100 points. Credit to xmatute-, otboumeh, dangonz3, and to all those other
people that helped me so much.

Remember to question and understand evethything. Do make your own tests, and learn how to
properly write a main function. Good learning!
