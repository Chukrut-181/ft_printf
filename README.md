This is my second project as a 42 student, ft_printf. Find it here as it was evaluated
and awarded 100 points. It is a fun and easy project, as long as you pay attention to
the little details that can ruin it... as it happened to me.

Credit to xmatute-, otboumeh, dangonz3, dalabrad and to all those other
people that helped me so much.

Remember to question and understand evethything. Do make your own tests, and learn how to
properly write a main function. Good learning!
